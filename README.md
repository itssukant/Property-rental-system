# Property-rental-system
This Property Rental Application is a website which serves people to find properties or homes in a
locality. The website is made on localhost and phpMyAdmin. The front end of the website is made
with HTML,CSS and JavaScript. The user can sign up to the website to make his account and then
login to access the features. After logging in, he/she can add rooms or properties and set them as
vacant or occupied with even the images of the property (by using uploading images with php).
The home page of user login will display the kind of number of properties he/she have added to
the websiteâ€™s database. The user can also file a complaint which can be seen by the admin. The
user can edit or delete or update his/her property. Then we come to the admin log in. The admin
login is a unique login stored at the database. The admin has access over the whole application.
The admin after logging in can view the total no. of users registered and total number of properties
registered on the dashboard. The admin can edit, delete or modify the property details of any user.
The admin can also file a complaint over a property for a specific user. All the complaints filled by
the users are available and visible to the admin. Further admin can send messages regarding
complaints or general notices through php email protocol. The website is fired up by WampServer
and localhost. The database is stored at phpMyAdmin. It can be viewed from over there. This
application is very user friendly and can come very handy.
